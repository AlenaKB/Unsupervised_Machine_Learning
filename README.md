# Analyzing cryptocurrencies

In this project I cleaned and prepared data for unsupervised machine learning algorithms, using Python Pandas.
The main objective was to get a grip on clustering. With PCA I reduced dimensions of my dataset and tried to predict the best number of clusters through K-means.
I created three different visualizations of the outcome, including 2 scatter plots and one table.

Prerequisites:
Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and sklearn libraries
