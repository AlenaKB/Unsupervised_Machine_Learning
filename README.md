# Cryptocurrencies Analysis 

## Project Objective 
Use unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market. Predict clusters using the K-means algorithm from sklearn. 

### Methods Used:
- Machine Learning
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering 
- Data Visualization

### Technologies 
- Python 3.0
- scikit-learn library 
- Matplotlib

## Project Description
In this project I cleaned and prepared data for unsupervised machine learning algorithms, using Python Pandas.
The main objective was to get a grip on clustering. With PCA I reduced dimensions of my dataset and tried to predict the best number of clusters through K-means.
I created three different visualizations of the outcome, including 2 scatter plots and one table.
