# Analyzing cryptocurrencies

The goals for this challenge are to:

Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

In this project I cleaned and prepared data for unsupervised machine learning algorithms, using Python Pandas.
The main objective was to get a grip on clustering. With PCA I reduced dimensions of my dataset and tried to predict the best number of clusters through K-means.
I created three different visualizations of the outcome, including 2 scatter plots and one table.

Prerequisites:
Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and sklearn libraries
